# Add circuit breaker pattern:
defmodule Kyozo.Containers.CircuitBreaker do
  def call(operation, service_name) do
    case get_circuit_state(service_name) do
      :closed -> execute_operation(operation)
      :open -> {:error, :circuit_open}
      :half_open -> try_operation(operation, service_name)
    end
  end
end
```

  Enum.each(running_services, fn service ->
    %{"service_instance_id" => service.id}
    |> __MODULE__.new(schedule_in: :rand.uniform(30))
    |> Oban.insert()
  end)
end

# Benefits:
