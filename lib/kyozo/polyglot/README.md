# üé≠ Kyozo Polyglot: When Markdown Dreams of Being More

> "I am not a markdown file. I am a free-form, multi-paradigmatic, self-actualizing document entity." - Every Polyglot Document

## What is Polyglot?

Polyglot is a revolutionary parser and transpiler that recognizes markdown's hidden potential. It understands that markdown files aren't just documentation - they're:

- üê≥ **Dockerfiles in disguise**
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes manifests masquerading as guides**  
- üèóÔ∏è **Terraform configurations cosplaying as tutorials**
- üìÅ **Git repositories pretending to be READMEs**
- üîÆ **Executable programs hiding in plain sight**

## The Philosophy

Traditional parsers see markdown and think "ah, documentation." Polyglot sees markdown and thinks "ah, infinite possibility."

```elixir
# Traditional parsing
markdown |> parse() |> render_html()

# Polyglot parsing  
markdown |> parse() |> become_universe()
```

## Features That Defy Reality

### üé™ Language Detection
Polyglot can detect what your markdown *really* wants to be:

```elixir
"# My App\n```dockerfile\nFROM elixir\n```"
|> Polyglot.parse()
|> Map.get(:language)
# => :dockerfile
```

### üé® Hidden Data Extraction
Polyglot finds data where others see emptiness:

- **Zero-width characters**: `Hello‚Äã‚Äå‚Äç‚Å†World` (there's a secret between Hello and World)
- **Content-addressed links**: `[Secret](e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855)`
- **Whitespace patterns**: Morse code? Binary? Art? Yes.
- **HTML comments**: `<!-- polyglot:enlightenment=maximum -->`

### üöÄ Transpilation Magic
Transform markdown into anything:

```elixir
markdown
|> Polyglot.parse()
|> Polyglot.transpile(:docker)
|> Docker.build!()
|> Universe.deploy!()
```

### üé≠ Multi-Format Documents
One document, many faces:

```markdown
# My Project

This is documentation AND:
- A Dockerfile (see the code blocks)
- A Kubernetes deployment (check the YAML)
- A complete git repository (notice the file: blocks)
- An executable script (it has a shebang!)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Parsing
```elixir
doc = Polyglot.parse(your_markdown)

doc.language      # What it really is
doc.artifacts     # Extracted executable parts
doc.metadata      # Hidden information
doc.ast          # The structure beneath
```

### Detecting Polyglot Documents
```elixir
if Polyglot.polyglot?(markdown) do
  IO.puts("This markdown transcends its medium!")
end
```

### Sanitizing Documents
```elixir
# Remove all the magic, return to mundane markdown
plain = Polyglot.sanitize(magical_markdown)
```

## The AST of Dreams

Polyglot builds an AST that sees beyond syntax:

```elixir
%{
  type: :code,
  language: "dockerfile",
  content: "FROM elixir",
  polyglot: :container_definition  # <-- It knows!
}
```

## Hidden Features

### üïµÔ∏è Steganographic Capabilities
Hide entire applications in whitespace:

```
This looks like a normal paragraph.    „ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ   „ÄÄ  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ
But those trailing spaces? They're binary.
```

### üîó Content-Addressed Linking
Links that are also data storage:

```markdown
[Click here](sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855)
```

### üé™ Executable Markdown
```markdown
<!-- polyglot:executable -->
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "I am markdown"
echo "I am also a program"
echo "I am Polyglot"
```
```

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Core Parsing** - Detects all major infrastructure formats  
‚úÖ **Metadata Extraction** - Finds hidden data in comments, whitespace, and Unicode  
‚úÖ **AST Building** - Creates rich abstract syntax trees  
‚úÖ **Language Detection** - Identifies true document purpose  
‚úÖ **Artifact Extraction** - Pulls out executable components  

üöß **Transpilers** - Need implementation for each target format  
üöß **Executors** - Need implementation for running extracted code  

## The Future

Imagine a world where:
- Documentation deploys itself
- READMEs build their own containers
- Tutorials execute as you read them
- Markdown files are actually distributed systems

That world is here. That world is Polyglot.

## Contributing

To contribute to Polyglot, your markdown must:
1. Believe in itself
2. Dream of being more than text
3. Hide at least one secret in its whitespace
