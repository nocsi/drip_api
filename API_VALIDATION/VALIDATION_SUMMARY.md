## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### **Priority 1: Broken API Integration** 
```bash

   Impact: 14 endpoints returning 404/500 errors
   Root Cause: Missing Kyozo.JSONAPI modules
   Effort: 1-2 weeks to fix or remove

‚ùå DocumentsController/Files route mismatch  
   Impact: File operations fail
   Root Cause: Controller expects documents, routes declare files
   Effort: 1 week to align naming and functionality
```

### **Priority 2: Incomplete Core Features**
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Container system mock-only implementation
   Impact: No real container deployment possible
   Root Cause: Docker integration incomplete
   Effort: 2-3 weeks for production Docker integration

‚ö†Ô∏è Notebook execution engine incomplete
   Impact: Code execution workflows broken
   Root Cause: Multi-language execution logic missing
   Effort: 2-3 weeks for complete implementation
```

### **Priority 3: Performance & Consistency**
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è File operations lack pagination
   Impact: Poor performance with large workspaces
   Root Cause: No pagination implementation
   Effort: 1 week to add proper pagination

‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent error response formats
   Impact: Poor API developer experience
   Root Cause: Mixed error handling patterns
   Effort: 1 week to standardize
```
