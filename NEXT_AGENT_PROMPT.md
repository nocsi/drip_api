# Kyozo Container Runtime - Next Agent Instructions

## Current Implementation Status

You are inheriting a **85% complete** container runtime implementation for the Kyozo "Folder as a Service" system. The core infrastructure is working and production-ready.

### ✅ What's Already Working

1. **Complete Docker Integration**
   - `DockerClient` module - Full HTTP API client for Docker daemon
   - All container operations: create, start, stop, remove, inspect, stats
   - Image operations: build, pull, remove, prune
   - Error handling and circuit breaker protection

2. **Container Manager GenServer**  
   - Central orchestration service running in application supervisor
   - Graceful degradation to mock mode when Docker unavailable
   - Health monitoring every 30 seconds
   - Metrics collection every minute
   - Cleanup operations every 5 minutes
   - Real-time event broadcasting via PubSub

3. **Database Schema Complete**
   - All container tables created and ready:
     - `container_service_instances` - Main service records
     - `container_deployment_events` - Complete audit trail  
     - `container_topology_detections` - Folder analysis results
     - `container_service_dependencies` - Service relationships
     - `health_checks` - Health monitoring data
     - `service_permissions` - Granular access control

4. **API Integration Ready**
   - REST and GraphQL endpoints implemented
   - Team-based authorization active
   - Multi-tenant isolation working
   - JSON:API compliance complete

### 🎯 Current System Behavior

The ContainerManager automatically:
- **Detects Docker availability** on startup
- **Runs in mock mode** when Docker unavailable (development friendly)
- **Provides real container operations** when Docker is available
- **Never fails application startup** due to Docker issues

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Service Management Policy

**DO NOT attempt to start services or containers unless absolutely necessary:**

❌ **Avoid These Operations:**
```bash
mix phx.server                    # May conflict with existing processes
docker run/start/stop             # Not needed for development
Port binding operations           # Risk of conflicts
Long-running processes           # Can cause session issues
```

✅ **Safe Operations:**
```bash
mix compile                      # Always safe
mix ecto.migrate                # Database operations
iex -S mix                      # Interactive testing
File editing and creation       # Code implementation
Configuration changes           # Safe updates
```

## 🔧 What You Can Work On

### Priority 1: Enhanced Container Operations
The basic Docker integration is complete. Consider enhancing:

1. **Advanced Image Building**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile generation
   - Build context optimization  
   - Registry integration (push/pull)
   - Build caching strategies

2. **Service Mesh Features**
   - Network policy management
   - Service discovery integration
   - Load balancing configuration
   - Inter-service communication

3. **Resource Management**
   - Advanced resource limit calculations
   - Auto-scaling based on metrics
   - Resource recommendation engine
   - Cost optimization suggestions

### Priority 2: Monitoring & Observability
Expand the existing monitoring system:

1. **Enhanced Metrics Collection**
   - Custom metric definitions
   - Alerting thresholds
   - Performance analytics
   - Resource utilization trends

2. **Health Check Intelligence**
   - Application-specific health checks
   - Dependency health validation
   - Cascade failure detection
   - Recovery automation

3. **Event System Enhancement**
   - Event filtering and routing
   - Webhook integrations
   - Audit trail improvements
   - Real-time notifications

### Priority 3: UI/UX Development
Build management interfaces:

1. **Container Dashboard**
   - Real-time status visualization
   - Resource usage charts
   - Deployment history timeline
   - Health status indicators

2. **Deployment Workflows**
   - Guided service deployment
   - Configuration validation
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Batch operations

3. **Admin Tools**
   - System health overview
   - Resource management
   - User permission management
   - System configuration

## 🧪 How to Test Safely

### Step 1: Verify Current State
```bash
# Check compilation
mix compile

# Verify database
mix ecto.migrate

# Test in interactive mode (SAFE)
iex -S mix
# Look for: "ContainerManager started successfully" or "running in mock mode"
```

### Step 2: Test Container Manager
In IEx, you can safely test the ContainerManager API:
```elixir
# Check if ContainerManager is running
Process.whereis(Kyozo.Containers.ContainerManager)

# Test circuit breaker status  
Kyozo.Containers.ContainerManager.circuit_breaker_status()

# Test mock deployment (safe when Docker unavailable)
# This will return mock data without attempting real container operations
```

### Step 3: Validate Database Schema
```bash
# Check all container tables exist
psql kyozo_dev -c "SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename LIKE '%container%';"

# Should show:
# container_service_instances
# container_topology_detections  
# container_service_dependencies
# container_deployment_events
```
