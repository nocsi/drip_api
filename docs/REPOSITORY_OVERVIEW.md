# Kyozo Store - Repository Overview & Current Implementation

## **üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture**
**Elixir/Phoenix Backend** with modern stack:
- **Ash Framework** - Declarative resource modeling for domains
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time web interface
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database with multi-tenancy
- **Oban** - Background job processing
- **Authentication** - Multi-strategy auth (email/password, OAuth ready)

## **üé® Frontend Infrastructure**
**Modern Svelte 5 + TypeScript**:
- **Svelte 5 with Runes** - Latest reactive syntax (`$props()`, `$state()`, `$derived()`)
- **ShadCN UI Components** - Professional component library via `bits-ui` 
- **TailwindCSS 4.0** - Latest utility-first styling
- **TipTap Editor** - Rich text editor with collaborative features
- **LiveSvelte Integration** - Seamless Phoenix + Svelte integration

## **üìÅ Domain Structure**

### **Accounts Domain** (`lib/kyozo/accounts/`)
‚úÖ **Complete implementation**:
- Users, Teams, Groups, Permissions
- Role-based access control 
- API keys, tokens, invitations
- OAuth2 integration ready
- Email notifications system

### **Workspaces Domain** (`lib/kyozo/workspaces/`)
‚úÖ **Core features implemented**:
- Workspace CRUD with team collaboration
- File management with versioning
- File types: Documents, Notebooks, Media, Images
- Storage abstraction (RAM, S3, Disk providers)
- Markdown rendering with post-processing
- Real-time collaborative editing foundation

### **Projects Domain** (`lib/kyozo/projects/`)
üîÑ **Basic structure**:
- Project and Document models
- Task management
- Load event tracking

### **Storage System** (`lib/kyozo/storage/`)
‚úÖ **Advanced file handling**:
- Abstract storage layer with multiple backends
- File encryption and content processing
- Upload protocol with metadata extraction
- Background workers for processing
- Locator system for file addressing

## **üåê API Layer**
- **JSON:API** - RESTful endpoints with proper serialization
- **GraphQL** - Query interface via Ash GraphQL
- **OpenAPI** - Specification generation and documentation

## **üéØ Frontend Apps** (`assets/svelte/`)
**Application Structure**:
- **Landing Page** - Professional marketing site with hero, features, pricing
- **Authentication** - Login/register forms with email/OAuth flows  
- **Dashboard** - User workspace overview and project management
- **Editor Components** - Rich text editing with TipTap integration
- **Team Management** - Collaboration features and user management
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with iOS optimization

## **üîß Developer Experience**
- **Docker** ready with dev/prod configurations
- **Deployment** scripts and fly.toml for hosting
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive API docs and specifications  
- **Testing** setup with Phoenix Test
- **Hot Reloading** - Vite dev server integration
- **Usage Rules** - Package-specific development guidelines

## **‚ùå Missing "Folder as a Service" Core Features**

According to the implementation status, the critical differentiating features are **not yet implemented**:

1. **Topology Detection Engine** - No folder structure analysis or service classification
2. **Container Orchestration** - No Docker integration for deploying folder contents
3. **AI Navigation System** - No intelligent folder understanding or path walking
4. **Service Instance Management** - Missing service deployment and lifecycle management
5. **Docker Compose Integration** - No automatic multi-service orchestration

## **üéØ Current Capability**
**What works now**: Professional collaborative workspace platform with:
- Multi-user teams and workspaces
- Rich file management and editing
- Real-time collaboration
- Professional UI/UX
- Secure authentication and permissions

**What's missing**: The revolutionary "any folder becomes a running service" functionality that differentiates Kyozo from traditional file managers.

## **üìä Repository Statistics**
- **Backend**: ~150+ Elixir modules across domains
- **Frontend**: Modern Svelte 5 components with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive migrations
- **Dependencies**: 40+ carefully curated packages
- **Documentation**: Extensive specs and API documentation
- **Tests**: Phoenix Test framework integration

## **üöÄ Next Steps Priority**
The foundation is solid and production-ready, but the core value proposition (automatic service deployment from folder structure) requires significant development work as outlined in the implementation roadmap:

1. **Phase 1**: Service Instance resources and Docker integration
2. **Phase 2**: Topology detection and classification engine  
3. **Phase 3**: AI navigation and folder intelligence
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced orchestration and production features

**Timeline**: 16-20 weeks for full "Folder as a Service" implementation with proper team resources.

The current platform provides an excellent foundation for building the revolutionary container orchestration features that will make Kyozo unique in the DevOps space.
